            <h2>Analysis of Data 1</h2>
            <p>The first graph, although visually well-represented, doesn’t convey much useful information. It compares general mental health and stress over the last 10 years with stress during COVID-19. While it clearly shows a decline in mental health, it lacks a title and more engaging visualization techniques.</p>
            <p>Using different colors to differentiate between male and female respondents is helpful, but using pie charts or other engaging formats could improve its impact.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="data2">
            <h2>Analysis of Data 2</h2>
            <p>The second graph is better constructed, featuring labeled axes, colors, and a timeline of months. The bar graphs make sense but could be visually more interesting. Again, the lack of a title reduces clarity. The filled-in bars with different colors are visually appealing, but the data representation is not immediately clear.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="data3">
            <h2>Analysis of Data 3</h2>
            <p>Graphs sourced from research articles use algorithms to analyze mental distress, perceived stress, and more. While these graphs have titles, they lack labeled axes. Simple labels like “Age groups” on the x-axis and descriptions of scores on the y-axis would make them more comprehensible.</p>
            <p>Line graphs and color differentiation between age groups improve readability, but structuring the graphs with clearer labels would enhance their effectiveness.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="graph1">
            <h2>Graph 1 with Explanation</h2>
            <p>This graph needs clearer labeling and a more engaging visualization approach. Pie charts or annotated visuals could enhance understanding.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="graph2">
            <h2>Graph 2 with Explanation</h2>
            <p>This graph effectively uses colors and time progression but lacks a title and immediate clarity in its data representation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="data-analysis">
            <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Children:</strong> Suffered from distress and isolation due to school closures and loss of social activities. Increased screen time and negative social media exposure contributed to mental health challenges.</p>
            <p><strong>Adolescents:</strong> Experienced anxiety, depression, and loneliness due to school disruptions and lack of social interactions. Concerns about academic and career goals were prevalent.</p>
            <p><strong>Adults:</strong> Faced anxiety, job loss, and work-from-home stress. The blurred distinction between work and personal life led to mental health struggles, including burnout.</p>
            <p><strong>Elderly:</strong> Suffered from social exclusion, isolation, and health fears due to lockdowns. Increased anxiety and loneliness significantly impacted their well-being.</p>
            <p>All age groups experienced loneliness, isolation, and anxiety, with unique challenges for each. Understanding these mental health impacts provides a comprehensive view of the pandemic’s effects on different demographics.</p>
